Since Java 1.8 it doesn't include so I need to download JavaFX and configure it as global library and write a config
file for more details - see the first 2 lectures for more information

*Structure: MVC*
Model: The application data model
View: Fxml
Controller: the code that determines what happens when the user interacts with the UI
1 Stage => multiple scenes => scene graph => Node (UI Control)
analogy of a play. the curtain rises and the play start. I watch the first scene, the scene ends and the curtain falls
the is some preparation for the next scene. The scene change ( an ew fxml file is loaded) but the stage stays the same.
change scene: calling Stage.setScene()
show(): show the UI

*The main class extends Application*
3 important methods: start(), init(), stop()
init(): the method that run first when the application is lunched
start(): the method that run next.Get as an argument the primary stage => top level window
stop(): when the application is closed. I can do some cleaning staff

*Javafx Coding process*
I can code a JavaFx App: 1. inside the class, with code   2. inside the fXML file
the second option is preferred
